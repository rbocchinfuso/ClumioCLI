# CLI wrapper for the Clumio API

## Summary
A Python CLI wrapper for the Clumio API.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub discussions, or DM me on the twitter @rbocchinfuso._

#### Why
I have a customer using Veeam to perform VMware on-prem backups, and Clumio for off-prem (off-site) backups.  I needed a way to trigger backups with a post Veeam job completion script.  The idea being that the Veeam jobs run to local a local repository, once the job is complete the Clumio on-demand job is triggered by a post command.  This avoids the inevitable Veeam and Clumio VM snapshot conflict.

#### Todo
- Add any other relevant CLI commands.

## Requirements
- Python 3
	- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is a good choice, and what I use regardless of platform.
- All other requirements are in the _requirements.txt_ file.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Usage
- Download code from GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/rbocchinfuso/ClumioCLI.git
```
- Note:  If you don't have Git installed you can also just grab the zip: https://github.com/rbocchinfuso/ClumioCLI/archive/master.zip

- Copy config.ini.example to config.ini and modify as required
